Can you help me evaluate your image recognition skills? I'm looking into if multi-modal image processing could be a valid alternative to OCR when preprocessing documents for retrieval from a vectorDB. So my request is could you describe the supplied image as well as you can under the consideration that someone who is searching for this image, his query should match with your description?

Certainly! Here is a detailed description of the provided image:

### Image Description

**Title:** Graph comparing Pre-imatix and imatix quant types

**Axes:**
- **X-axis:** Labeled "bpw" (units range from 2.0 to 5.0)
- **Y-axis:** Labeled "PPL(Q)/PPL(fp16)-1 (%)" (logarithmic scale ranging from 1 to 100)

**Legend:**
- **Black circles:** Pre-imatix k-quants
- **Blue circles:** Pre-imatix legacy quants
- **Pink circles:** imatix legacy quants
- **Red circles:** imatix i- and k-quants
- **Dashed red line:** Fit 1062*exp(-1.66463*bpw)

**Data Points:**
- **Red circles:** Labeled from "IQ2_XXS" to "IQ3_M" (with variations like "IQ2_XS", "IQ2_S", etc.)
- **Black circles:** Labeled "Q2_K", "Q3_K_S", "Q3_K_M", "Q3_K_L"
- **Blue circles:** Labeled "Q4_0", "Q4_1"
- **Pink circles:** Labeled "Q4_K_M"
- **Cyan circle:** Labeled "IQ4_XS"

**Trend:**
- The red dashed line indicates an exponential fit of the data, showing a general decreasing trend as bpw increases.
- Red circles generally follow the trend line closely.
- Black, blue, and pink circles deviate at higher bpw values.

**Visual Summary:**
The graph illustrates the performance of different quantization methods (pre-imatix and imatix) over varying bits per weight (bpw). Each quantization type is represented by differently colored and labeled circles. A red dashed line shows an exponential decay fitting the imatix i- and k-quants data points.

This description should help users searching for a graph comparing different quantization methods based on their performance relative to bpw and labeled with different quant types to find this image.
